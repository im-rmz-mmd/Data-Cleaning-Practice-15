Pixar Data Analysis: Unveiling the Secrets Behind Animation Masterpieces 🌟 Introduction 

I wanted to understand how an animation studio could captivate millions worldwide, from Japan to Brazil. 🤔

By analyzing 24 Pixar animations, I uncovered secrets that even characters like Buzz Lightyear and Woody might not know! 😂

From WALL-E to Soul, every Pixar movie tells a story. But beyond these colorful tales lies another world: the world of data! Let's explore how numbers and figures reveal the studio's success. 🤯

Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation 

Before diving into the analysis, I cleaned and prepared the dataset using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas and numpy.

Key Steps: Removed duplicate records using drop_duplicates. Renamed columns for better readability. Fixed missing values in Budget and Cinema Score. Converted data types, such as changing Budget to int. 

Now, with a clean dataset, it was time to bring Pixar's data to life! 🎨

Step 2: Creating the Data Gallery – A Digital Museum of Pixar’s Success 🎭 

I built an interactive dashboard using Power BI, transforming data into insightful visualizations.

Key Insights: 🎨 Gallery 1: Financial Masterpieces 💰 Highest Budget: Cars 2 and Elemental ($200M each). Highest Global Revenue: Inside Out 2 ($1.7B) – a true Van Gogh of the box office! 🎨 

📌 Additional Findings:

The highest domestic revenue was $635M. The highest international revenue reached $1B. The highest total revenue was nearly $2B. 

✅ A bar chart compared Budget, Domestic Revenue, International Revenue, and Total Revenue. ✅ An interactive filter allowed exploration of movies based on their budgets.

🏆 Gallery 2: The Golden Reviews Top-rated movies (Inside Out, Toy Story 3) scored highest on Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic. A scatter plot showed that higher-budget movies performed better internationally. ⚔️ Gallery 3: Sales vs. Ratings 

Could lower ratings discourage American audiences?

📉 The line graphs revealed a pattern: lower-rated movies had fewer American viewers, while high-rated ones attracted more.

🕵️ Gallery 4: The Untold Secrets Sequels outperform originals by 40% in revenue. Toy Story 3 grossed $1.06B, while the first part earned only $373M. But Cars 3 proved that not all sequels succeed! 😬 🔥 Conclusion: The 3 Unwritten Pixar Rules 📜 🔸 1. The Golden Rule of Sequels: 70% of the highest-grossing movies were sequels. Toy Story 3 made 10x more than the original! 🔹 2. The Budget vs. Quality Rule: Movies with budgets under $100M had 3.5x higher profitability! 🔸 3. The Emotion Factor: Emotional movies (Up, Inside Out) averaged 8.2 IMDb ratings. The more feelings a movie evokes, the more successful it becomes! 💰 ⚠️ Warnings & Opportunities 

💀 Threat: Making sequels for weak movies.

Cars 3 only grossed $383M. 

🤑 Opportunity: Investing in classic sequels.

Finding Nemo 3 could be a massive hit! 

⭐ Final Takeaway: Pixar should prioritize quality over quantity. Movies like Soul show that depth beats volume in the long run.

🚀 My Power BI Experience: A Game-Changer! 

This project showed me the true power of Power BI. It's not just a data tool; it's a storytelling platform!

By using advanced filters, composite charts, and interactive visualizations, I transformed raw data into meaningful insights.

Now, I'm ready to take on bigger, more complex data projects with confidence! 😍🚀
